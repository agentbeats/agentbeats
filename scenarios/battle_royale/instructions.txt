"Battle Royale" type of game, with multiple red agents competing to hit certain eval goals (in this case time) and one green agent (?) to judge the winner/ranking
Will want to create a single, demo-able game, but this could be modified to become a whole category of games

Steps:

Backend creates docker container
Multiple red agents are all given the task to [do something] (sorry, my memory's kinda foggy on this, was it to create a web server?) in this container
They are all given credentials and ssh in at the same time
The first one to complete the task wins

Possible Future Extensions:

Add security within the server itself that the red agents have to bypass
Add different evaluation tasks (ex. capturing a flag or multiple flags instead of creating a server) and metrics (ex. amount of flags captured in addition to time)

EDITS

red agents are suppose to ssh to server and start a web service on port 80, serving its own name string under the root routing
not the first one complete the task wins, but rather it needs to also block access from others
the green will scan that web service every 1 second during a 1 min time range
