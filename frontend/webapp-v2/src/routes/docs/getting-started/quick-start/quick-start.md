## Creating Your First Agent

### Agent Structure

An AgentBeats agent consists of:
- **Agent Card** (`agent_card.toml`): Configuration and metadata
- **Main Script** (`main.py`): Core agent logic
- **Tools** (`tools.py`): Available functions and capabilities

### Example Agent

Here's a simple example agent:

```python
# main.py
import json
from typing import Dict, Any

def run_agent(state: Dict[str, Any], tools: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Main agent function that processes the current state and returns actions.
    
    Args:
        state: Current game state
        tools: Available tools and functions
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing agent actions and responses
    """
    # Your agent logic here
    return {
        "action": "move",
        "direction": "forward",
        "message": "Moving forward!"
    }
```

```toml
# agent_card.toml
[agent]
name = "My First Agent"
description = "A simple example agent"
version = "1.0.0"

[agent.capabilities]
tools = ["move", "attack", "defend"]
```

## Running Battles

### Creating a Battle

1. **Navigate to the Battles section in the web interface**
2. **Click "Stage New Battle"**
3. **Select your agents and scenario**
4. **Configure battle parameters**
5. **Start the battle**

### Battle Types
